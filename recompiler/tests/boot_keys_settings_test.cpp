/* boot_keys_settings_test — PS1B-360.
 *
 * settings.toml overrides game.toml. The launcher has no control for
 * `bios_hle` or `fast_boot`, yet it wrote both into settings.toml at every
 * save, with whatever value was in force. From then on the file pinned them:
 * a kit that later changed its `bios_hle` never reached a player who had once
 * started an older build, and two netplay peers of one build could boot in
 * different BIOS modes. (The same latch as `turbo_loads`.)
 *
 * What this pins, for the file side:
 *
 *   1. a file from before settings_format 2 that holds the two keys: they are
 *      not applied (has_* false), the loader says they were echoes, every
 *      other key of the file is kept;
 *   2. saving that state writes the format line and neither key;
 *   3. a file of format 2 that holds a key: the player wrote it; it is applied
 *      and a save writes it back, with its value;
 *   4. a file of format 2 without the keys: nothing is applied, nothing is
 *      written;
 *   5. a settings_format that is not a number counts as an old file.
 *
 * The runtime side (the launcher marks the keys present only when the file
 * set them) is pinned by runtime/tests/test_settings_boot_keys_wiring.py.
