"""Guard that the LAN / Direct IP lobby checks a guest's build and game (PS1B-295).

test_netplay_lan_version.c proves the two rules. This proves main.cpp applies
them: the JOIN carries both lines, both host JOIN handlers refuse before they
seat anyone, the guest shows the reason, and the same-machine room file is
offered only to the title that wrote it. The lobby code runs inside the
launcher and needs sockets and a second peer, so the wiring is checked in the
source, as test_launcher_pad_mode_wiring.py does for the launcher.
