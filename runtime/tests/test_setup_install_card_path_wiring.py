"""Guard how the setup install's card folder is WIRED into main() (PS1B-252).

A setup install keeps settings.toml in <root>/build-release and its memory
cards in <root>/saves. The launcher wrote the card folder by full path, so a
moved or copied install kept using the old folder: an empty card for the
player, or the other copy's saves.

recompiler/tests/portable_settings_paths_test.cpp proves the rule itself:
with the install's root known, save_user_settings() writes "../saves", and a
moved copy resolves that to its own folder. This proves main() uses the rule:

  1. it gives the loader's project root to the settings writer, and
  2. every [memcard] value read from settings.toml goes through the helper
     that anchors a relative value on the exe folder and folds the climb.

Reading source rather than running a binary is deliberate: the code is in the
middle of main(), between the settings load and a launcher round-trip, and a
headless start never saves settings.
