"""The setup host's hand-over to the product honours a headless start.

A kit's own exe is the setup host. Once the game is built it starts the product
in build-release and exits. It added --launcher to that start, always, so that
the product's persisted skip_launcher setting cannot hide the launcher on a
hand-over. In the product --launcher wins over --no-launcher, --headless,
PSX_NO_LAUNCHER and PSX_HEADLESS. So a scripted start of a kit's own exe always
waited in the launcher, and a gate that starts the kit the way a player does
could not get a frame from the game it hands over to (PS1B-402: no gate made
that start, and six public kits that never handed over passed).

This builds the real host translation unit into a stand-in setup program, puts
a stand-in product where the host looks for it, and reads the arguments the
product was started with:

  a player's start      --launcher is added, once, after the caller's arguments;
  a headless start      one of the signals the product honours itself, read by
                        the product's own rules: --no-launcher, --headless,
                        --replay <file>; PSX_NO_LAUNCHER present, whatever its
                        value; PSX_HEADLESS set to something other than empty
                        or a value that starts with 0. The arguments are
                        forwarded as they are, with no --launcher;
  not a headless start  PSX_HEADLESS=0, and --replay without its file.

Without recomp-ui or a C compiler the test cannot run: it says SKIP and exits
77, which ctest reports as "Skipped", not as "Passed" (SKIP_RETURN_CODE).

The setup host is a real program with a toolchain installer in it. A start with
--diagnostic (or PSXRECOMP_DIAGNOSTIC, or a diagnostic-mode.txt beside it) and
no diagnostic product makes it "ensure" the build toolchain: it removes the
installed pack's folder and installs a downloaded one. On 2026-10-02 a first
version of this test had such a case and emptied the build host's toolchain.
So the host here runs in a closed environment (host_environment):

  - no case may pass a switch that asks for a build (FORBIDDEN_ARGS);
  - the environment is built from nothing, not copied: every folder the host
    derives a toolchain or data root from (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, USERPROFILE,
    HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME, RETCOMM_DATA_HOME, RETCOMM_TOOLCHAIN_CACHE, TEMP, TMP)
    is a folder inside the test's own temporary folder, PATH holds the system
    folders only, and no variable names a toolchain;
  - the proxy variables point at a closed local port, so a download cannot work;
  - after the cases the toolchain and data folders must still be empty. A file
    there means the host tried to install something: the test fails.

--dry-run prints that environment and the cache bases the host derives from it,
checks that every root is inside the temporary folder, and starts nothing.
