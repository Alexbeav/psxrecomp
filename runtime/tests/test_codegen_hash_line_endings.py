"""The overlay codegen hash must not depend on line endings.

runtime/hash_codegen.cmake is the one place that computes
PSX_OVERLAY_CODEGEN_HASH. Everything else reads the header it writes
(overlay_api.h, compile_overlays.codegen_hash, psxrecomp-game --codegen-hash,
the boot-state header, the packagers). The value names the overlay cache
folder and is compared across hosts, so a Windows, a Linux and a macOS build
of one pin must compute the same number.

Three of the hashed sources are stored with CRLF in git. The script reads each
file with CMake's file(READ), which returns LF line ends for a CRLF file, so
the value is the hash of the LF text on every host (pin G2: 0x6a0b6aaa on
Windows and on Linux; hashing the raw blobs gives 0xbb542d4f, which no build
uses). Nothing in the script says so, and a rewrite that hashed raw bytes
would split the cache folder name by host. This test holds the property.

This test:
  1. hashes an LF copy and a CRLF copy of one set of sources and requires the
     same value;
  2. pins the definition with a Python reference (SHA-256 over the sources,
     concatenated in list order, CRLF read as LF; first 8 hex digits);
  3. checks the real source list of this tree against that reference, so a
     host whose CMake reads a file differently fails here.
