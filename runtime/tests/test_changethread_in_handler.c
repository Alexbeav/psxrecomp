/* PS1B-417: a ChangeThread called inside an interrupt handler switches threads
 * at the call, as the kernel does.
 *
 * V-Rally 2 (SLUS-01003) runs its track set-up in a second thread. Its DMA
 * interrupt handler preempts that thread: it copies the interrupted context
 * out of the thread's control block and calls ChangeThread(main). Later the
 * main thread writes the copy back and calls ChangeThread to the set-up
 * thread, which continues where the interrupt took it. The runtime returned
 * from the handler's call into the interrupted thread instead, the thread ran
 * on, and the main thread's restore ran its work a second time (PS1G-76).
 *
 * The kernel's steps for SYS(03h), in a handler or out of one (SCPH-1001:
 * exception entry 0xC80, syscall handler 0x1A00, function 3 at 0x1AAC,
 * ReturnFromException 0xF40):
 *   1. the registers at the SYSCALL go into the block the current-thread
 *      pointer names, over what the interrupt saved there;
 *   2. that block's saved EPC is the SYSCALL's address plus 4;
 *   3. that block's saved v0 becomes 1, and the pointer takes a1;
 *   4. the return loads every register from the block the pointer now names.
 * Function 3 does not look at the target's state word.
 *
 * Production interrupts.c and traps.c deliver the interrupt, handle the
 * syscall and run the scheduler; rfe_guest_fixture.h is the guest. The driver
 * builds this file three times:
 *
 *   as it is: four interrupts hit the worker thread. The first handler
 *     returns plainly. The second calls ChangeThread to the main thread: the
 *     four steps are checked in the main thread, the worker must not have
 *     done another pass, and after the main thread writes the copy back the
 *     worker continues with the interrupted registers and does each pass
 *     once. The third calls ChangeThread to the worker itself, the current
 *     thread, and the fourth names an address outside the thread table: both
 *     stay a return to the interrupted code.
 *
 *   CHANGETHREAD_NO_RESTORE: the main thread switches back WITHOUT writing
 *     the copy back. The old block holds the handler's context, so the
 *     handler continues after its call, on its own stack, with v0 = 1.
 *
 *   CHANGETHREAD_NOT_RUNNABLE: the target block's state word says closed.
 *     The switch is made all the same.
 *
 * CHANGETHREAD_CONTROL is for sources from before the fix (no counters). */
