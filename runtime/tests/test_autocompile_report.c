/*
 * The overlay compile results of a start must reach the run report (PS1B-380).
 *
 * The runtime counts the compile driver's built and failed units and keeps the
 * tail of its output, but served both only through the debug server, which a
 * product does not have. A unit the compiler rejects runs interpreted and is
 * not "degraded", so a fleet of builds looked clean while clang refused
 * overlay units on Windows. autocompile_report_json() is what the run report
 * now carries under "overlay_compile".
 *
 * The driver here is a text file that the configured command prints ("cat" or
 * "type"): exactly the lines tools/compile_overlays.py prints. So this runs
 * the real path on every platform: spawn, pipe, line parser, accounting.
 *
 *   no run yet        every count is zero, no class, no tail;
 *   a clean run       the unit counts of its result line, no failure;
 *   a failing run     the count, the class, the first SHARD FAIL line, the
 *                     compiler's first error line, the tail; and one stderr
 *                     line per failure class;
 *   the same again    counts add up; the stderr line is not printed again;
 *   too many classes  the bound holds and says how many failures it left out.
 *   a quit mid-run    the report says that the quit stopped a run, and keeps the
 *                     result line that run had printed (PS1B-395).
