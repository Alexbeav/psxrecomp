/*
 * The overlay compiler child must not keep the runtime's files open (PS1B-378).
 *
 * autocompile_request() starts the compiler with CreateProcess and handle
 * inheritance, because the child writes to a pipe. Without a handle list the
 * child got every inheritable handle of the process, and every fopen() handle
 * is inheritable. The snapshot writer thread is usually in the middle of a
 * commit at that instant, so cmd.exe kept the commit's temp file open until the
 * compile run ended. The runtime then closed its own handle and renamed the
 * file: MoveFileEx failed with ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION (32), remove() failed
 * too, and every retry failed again while the compiler lived. In a cold start
 * that printed "additive capture history write failed" and "latest capture
 * write failed" a few times, delayed those snapshots by a whole compile run,
 * and left one overlay_captures.json.<pid>.<seq>.tmp in the game's folder per
 * "latest" line.
 *
 * The test, in two halves:
 *
 *   control  a child started the OLD way (inheritance on, no handle list)
 *            while a file is open: the rename of that file must FAIL with 32.
 *            This shows that the method sees the fault on this machine. A test
 *            that could not fail here would prove nothing.
 *   subject  the same file handling, the child started through
 *            autocompile_request(): the rename and the remove must SUCCEED
 *            while the child still runs, and the child's output must still
 *            arrive through the pipe.
 *
 * Windows only. On POSIX a file that a child holds open does not block a
 * rename or an unlink, so the fault cannot exist there; the test says so and
 * reports itself skipped (exit 77).
 *
 * Build/run: ctest -R autocompile_handle_inherit_test
