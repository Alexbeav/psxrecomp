"""Guard that the host tells the launcher whether a disc's serial is listed (PS1B-403).

A player gave a build made for SLES-03396 a disc of another release,
SLES-03398. The launcher's disc panel showed "Serial  SLES-03398" with a tick,
because it ticked any serial that was read, and the only sentence on the panel
was the online-play note about the TOC fingerprint. He could not tell that he
had the wrong release.

The launcher (recomp-ui, tests/launcher_disc_serial_test.c) now draws a cross
and says "This disc is X. This build needs Y." when the host says the serial
is not listed. This guard is the host's half: ae_disc_verify says so. The
callback needs a disc image and the launcher's window, so it is checked in the
source.
