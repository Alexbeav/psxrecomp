/* host_osd_wrap.h - line breaking for the host toast (PS1B-316).
 *
 * The toast is drawn in an 8x8 font at 2x, 16 pixels a character at the
 * smallest scale, 8 pixels in from the left edge. The narrowest window the
 * window-scale setting offers is 640 pixels wide, and at every 4:3 scale it
 * offers the toast scales with the window, so 39 characters is what fits.
 * A line is HOST_OSD_COLS characters, one less, and a message is at most
 * HOST_OSD_LINES lines. A longer message loses its end and shows "...".
 *
 * Breaking: a message that fits on one line stays on one line. Otherwise a
 * "Prefix: reason" message puts the prefix on its own line when the reason
 * then fits in the lines that are left; any other message breaks at spaces.
 * A word longer than a line is split.
 *
 * Kept free of SDL and of the OSD state so the breaking is unit-tested
 * directly (test_host_osd_wrap.c). */
