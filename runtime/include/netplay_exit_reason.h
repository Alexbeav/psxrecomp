 * whose system held the port read first that the build had no netplay.
 * `start_rc` is psx_netplay_start's result, `has_netplay` whether the build
 * has the netplay library. For a LAN start (-3) the caller does the library's
 * steps again and passes what it found: `bind_probe` and, for a refused bind
 * or socket, the system's error number and text. The sentence says a cause
 * only when the system's answer names one:
 *   address in use (Windows 10048, Linux 98, macOS 48): another program or
 *     the system holds the port, choose another port;
 *   access denied (Windows 10013, POSIX 13): the system does not allow the
 *     port (a range Windows keeps for Hyper-V or WSL, a port below 1024
 *     elsewhere), choose another port;
 *   address not available (Windows 10049, Linux 99, macOS 49): the listen
 *     address is not one of this computer's, check the listen address;
 *   any other number: the number and the system's text, no cause.
 * The peer address is named only when the listen address opened and the peer
 * address cannot be read. The build is named only when it has no netplay.
 * Every sentence fits the lobby client's last_error. */
