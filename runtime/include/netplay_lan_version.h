/* netplay_lan_version.h — the build and game checks for LAN / Direct IP rooms

 * The online lobby server refuses a join whose game_version differs from the
 * room's. A LAN / Direct IP room has no server, and its JOIN carried no
 * version, so two builds of different framework commits could meet there and
 * desync. The JOIN tail now ends with the guest's lobby version (line 7, after
 * the three BIOS lines, the two memory-card lines and the BIOS CRC), and the
 * host applies the server's rule.
