/* start_refusal.h — why a start ended before the first frame (PS1G-63).
 *
 * A start that is refused (a BIOS this build was not compiled from, no disc,
 * an image the drive cannot mount) returns from main() before any guest code
 * runs. The run report then read reason "atexit", exit_origin "unknown",
 * frame 0 for every one of those causes, and for a closed launcher window
 * too, so a player's report could not say why the game did not start.
 *
 * This module keeps the kind of the refusal and the sentence the player was
 * shown. crash_trace.c prints both into psx_last_run_report.json. It also
 * keeps what the launcher's BIOS and disc rows said last, because a launcher
 * that blocks Play ends as "launcher closed" with the reason on those rows.
 *
 * The report names a file by its base name, never by its folder: players
 * paste that file into a chat, and it held no path before. The box, which
 * only the player sees, may show the full path. See docs/RUN_REPORT_START.md.
 *
 * Fixed buffers, no allocation: the report writer also runs on the crash path.
