#ifndef PSX_BREAK_VECTOR_H
#define PSX_BREAK_VECTOR_H

/* A BREAK that the guest handles itself (PS1G-74, F1 2000).
 *
 * PSX-SPX "COP0 - Exception Handling": `break` raises exception code 09h (Bp)
 * through the general vector. F1 2000's STUB.EXE writes its own stub to
 * 0x80000080, executes `break 0xFB42`, and checks the value its handler left
 * in t0 after the handler returned to EPC+4 with `rfe`.
 *
 * Only a vector that the guest has pointed at its own code is entered. The
 * BIOS's handler has no route for code 09h but SystemErrorUnresolvedException,
 * so under it a BREAK keeps the fatal report of psx_break: the report names
 * the PC, and a console stops there too. One stub shape is accepted:
 * `lui rN,hi`, `ori|addiu rN,rN,lo`, `jr rN`, with a target in RAM at or above
 * 0x10000. The BIOS's own target is in the kernel below that. Any other
 * vector, a plain `j handler` included, is not entered.
 *
 * Only the interpreter calls this, and not for a BREAK in a branch delay slot
 * (EPC and BD would need the branch). The other executors do not come here:
 *   - compiled BIOS code calls psx_break (strict_translator.cpp) and keeps the
 *     fatal report: a handler would return to EPC+4 in the middle of a
 *     compiled function, which is neither an entry nor a call return;
 *   - compiled game code, which is a kit's static functions and every native
 *     overlay unit, executes nothing for a BREAK: the game generator emits a
 *     comment (code_generator.cpp), so the BREAK is skipped, with no report
 *     and no handler (PS1B-412).
 *
 * Returns 1 with the exception entered: EPC is the BREAK's own PC, Cause
 * holds code 9 with BD clear, the SR mode bits are pushed, and cpu->pc is the
 * vector for the flat dispatcher. Returns 0, with nothing changed, inside the
 * synchronous handler window, with SR.BEV set, and for any other vector. */
