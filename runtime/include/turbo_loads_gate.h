/* Fast Loading engage/hold gate (PS1B-241).
 *
 * The turbo-through-loads path runs the guest at a multiple of real time and
 * skips most presents while the game loads. It must engage for data loads
 * (RE3 door transitions: hundreds of sectors of ReadN) and not for the short
 * data reads a game makes while the player has control (RE3: ~11 vblanks of
 * reading every few seconds), nor for streamed audio (XA-ADPCM, CD-DA).
 *
 * Engage: at least TURBO_LOADS_WINDOW_READS of the last TURBO_LOADS_WINDOW
 * vblanks were data reads. Hold: while data reads continue or the drive's
 * load hold (the gap tail between read bursts) is on. Release: after
 * release_frames without either, then the window is cleared. */
