/* Create a file that must not exist yet and open it for writing.
 *
 * C11 gives fopen an exclusive-create flag for this. msvcrt.dll, the C runtime
 * of an MSYS2 MINGW64 build, rejects that flag: the call returns NULL for every
 * path, so a writer that uses it never writes there. An exclusive open()
 * followed by fdopen() does the same job on msvcrt, UCRT and POSIX (PS1B-206).
 *
 * `binary` chooses what the "b" of an fopen mode chooses. 0 is a text stream:
 * on Windows "\n" is written as "\r\n", as a text-mode fopen does. 1 writes the
 * bytes as given.
 *
 * Returns NULL when the file exists (errno EEXIST) or cannot be created. A file
 * that exists is never opened, cut short or changed. */
